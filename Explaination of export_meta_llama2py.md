# Explaination of export_meta_llama2.py file

This script is a Python program that exports the weights of a Llama 2 model into the `llama2c.bin` format. The exported binary file can be used to read the model weights from a C or C++ program, allowing for inference on devices that do not have Python or PyTorch support.

Here's a breakdown of the script:

1. It begins with the necessary imports, including modules from PyTorch and Python standard libraries.
2. The `export` function takes the model's state dictionary and writes the weights to a binary file in a specific format (`llama2c.bin`). The weights are serialized as 32-bit floating-point numbers (fp32).
3. The `concat_weights` function takes a list of model dictionaries, which are used to merge the model weights into a single state dictionary. It concatenates the weights along the specified axis and removes the original weights from each model dictionary.
4. The `load_and_export` function is the main entry point of the script. It loads the Llama 2 model, specified by the `model_path`, along with its parameters from a JSON file named `params.json`.
5. The script then loads individual model files (`consolidated.*.pth`) from the specified `model_path`, which contain model weights.
6. The `concat_weights` function is called to merge the loaded model dictionaries into a single state dictionary.
7. The `export` function is called to write the merged state dictionary into the `output_path` as a binary file in the `llama2c.bin` format.
8. The main block of the script parses the command-line arguments to get the `model_path` and `output_path` and then calls the `load_and_export` function.

Note: The script relies on certain model details that are specific to the Llama 2 model and assumes the existence of some functions and classes (`precompute_freqs_cis`, `model`). These details are not provided in the script, so it's likely that this script is part of a larger codebase that implements the Llama 2 model and related functions. If you intend to use this script, make sure you have the complete codebase, including the missing functions and classes, for the Llama 2 model.

Certainly! Let's go through the script line by line and explain each part:

```python
"""
This script exports the Llama 2 weights in llama2c.bin format.
"""

```

This is a multi-line comment that provides a brief description of what the script does. It states that the script exports Llama 2 model weights into the `llama2c.bin` format.

```python
import sys
import struct
from pathlib import Path
import json

import torch

from model import precompute_freqs_cis

```

These are the necessary imports for the script. It imports Python standard libraries such as `sys`, `struct`, `json`, and `pathlib`, as well as PyTorch (`torch`). Additionally, it imports the function `precompute_freqs_cis` from a module named `model`.

```python
def export(p, state_dict, filepath='model.bin'):
    """export the model weights in fp32 into .bin file to be read from C"""
    f = open(filepath, 'wb')

```

This defines the `export` function, which takes three arguments: `p`, `state_dict`, and `filepath`. The `p` argument is a dictionary containing certain parameters, the `state_dict` is the model's state dictionary containing the model's weights, and `filepath` is the name of the binary file to which the model weights will be exported.

The function opens the specified file in binary write mode ('wb').

```python
    def serialize(key):
        print(f"writing {key}...")
        t = state_dict[key].contiguous().view(-1).type(torch.float32).numpy()
        f.write(memoryview(t))
        del state_dict[key]

```

This defines a nested helper function `serialize`, which takes a key corresponding to a specific weight tensor from the `state_dict`. The function serializes the tensor into a one-dimensional array of 32-bit floating-point numbers (fp32) and writes it to the binary file.

It also prints a message indicating that the given key is being written. After writing the weight tensor to the file, the function deletes the corresponding entry from the `state_dict` to free up memory.

```python
    hidden_dim = state_dict['layers.0.feed_forward.w1.weight'].shape[0]
    p['vocab_size'] = 32000
    p['max_seq_len'] = 2048

    n_kv_heads = p.get('n_kv_heads') or p['n_heads']

```

These lines extract some specific information from the `state_dict` and the `p` (parameters) dictionary. It assigns values to `hidden_dim`, `vocab_size`, `max_seq_len`, and `n_kv_heads`.

```python
    header = struct.pack(
        'iiiiiii',
        p['dim'], hidden_dim, p['n_layers'], p['n_heads'],
        n_kv_heads, -p['vocab_size'], p['max_seq_len']
    )

```

This line uses the `struct.pack` function to create a binary header. It packs the values of `p['dim']`, `hidden_dim`, `p['n_layers']`, `p['n_heads']`, `n_kv_heads`, `-p['vocab_size']`, and `p['max_seq_len']` into a binary structure. The format string `'iiiiiii'` indicates that all the values are integers (each represented by 'i').

```python
    f.write(header)

```

The binary header is then written to the binary file.

```python
    print("writing tok_embeddings...")
    serialize('tok_embeddings.weight')

```

This prints a message indicating that the token embeddings are being written, and then it calls the `serialize` function to write the tensor with key `'tok_embeddings.weight'` to the binary file.

```python
    # now all the layers
    # attention weights
    for i in range(p['n_layers']): serialize(f'layers.{i}.attention_norm.weight')
    for i in range(p['n_layers']): serialize(f'layers.{i}.attention.wq.weight')
    for i in range(p['n_layers']): serialize(f'layers.{i}.attention.wk.weight')
    for i in range(p['n_layers']): serialize(f'layers.{i}.attention.wv.weight')
    for i in range(p['n_layers']): serialize(f'layers.{i}.attention.wo.weight')
    # ffn weights
    for i in range(p['n_layers']): serialize(f'layers.{i}.ffn_norm.weight')
    for i in range(p['n_layers']): serialize(f'layers.{i}.feed_forward.w1.weight')
    for i in range(p['n_layers']): serialize(f'layers.{i}.feed_forward.w2.weight')
    for i in range(p['n_layers']): serialize(f'layers.{i}.feed_forward.w3.weight')

```

These lines use a loop to iterate through all the layers of the model and serialize various weight tensors. It writes the weights associated with the attention and feed-forward layers for each layer of the model.

```python
    # final rmsnorm
    serialize('norm.weight')
    # freqs_cis
    freqs_cis = precompute_freqs_cis(p['dim'] // p['n_heads'], p['max_seq_len'] * 2)
    state_dict['freqs_cis.real'] = freqs_cis.real[:p['max_seq_len']]
    state_dict['freqs_cis.imag'] = freqs_cis.imag[:p['max_seq_len']]
    serialize('freqs_cis.real')
    serialize('freqs_cis.imag')

```

These lines serialize the final rmsnorm weight tensor and compute and serialize the real and imaginary parts of the `freqs_cis` tensor.

```python
    # finally write the output weights
    serialize('output.weight')

```

This line serializes and writes the weight tensor with key `'output.weight'` to the binary file.

```python
    f.close()
    print(f"wrote {filepath}")

```

The binary file is closed, and a message indicating that the file has been written is printed.

```python
def concat_weights(models):
    state_dict = {}
    for name in list(models[0]):
        tensors = [model[name] for model in models]
        if len(tensors) == 1 or len(tensors[0].shape) == 1:
            state_dict[name] = tensors[0]
            continue
        is_axis_1 = (
            name.startswith('tok_embeddings.')
            or name.endswith('.attention.wo.weight')
            or name.endswith('.feed_forward.w2.weight')
        )
        axis = 1 if is_axis_1 else 0
        state_dict[name] = torch.cat(tensors, dim=axis)
        for model in models:
            del model[name]
    return state_dict

```

This defines the `concat_weights` function, which takes a list of model dictionaries (`models`) as input. It creates a new `state_dict` dictionary that merges the weights from all the models in the list along the specified axis (axis 1 for certain weight tensors). After merging the weights, the function deletes the original weights from each model dictionary and returns the merged `state_dict`.

```python
def load_and_export(model_path, output_path):
    with open(model_path + 'params.json') as f:
        params = json

.load(f)
        print(params)

    model_paths = sorted(list(Path(model_path).glob('consolidated.*.pth')))
    models = []
    for i in model_paths:
        print(f'Loading {i}')
        models.append(torch.load(i, map_location='cpu'))

    state_dict = concat_weights(models)
    del models
    export(params, state_dict, output_path)

```

This defines the `load_and_export` function, which is the main entry point of the script. It takes two arguments: `model_path` (the folder path containing the Llama 2 model) and `output_path` (the path where the binary file will be saved).

The function starts by opening the `params.json` file inside the `model_path` and loading the parameters into the `params` dictionary.

Next, it locates all the model files (`consolidated.*.pth`) in the `model_path`, sorts them, and loads each model using PyTorch's `torch.load` function. The loaded models are appended to the `models` list.

Then, it calls the `concat_weights` function to merge the weights of all the models into a single `state_dict`.

Finally, it calls the `export` function to write the merged `state_dict` into a binary file specified by `output_path`.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) == 1:
        print('[Llama model folder path] [output path]')
        exit()

    model_path = sys.argv[1]
    output_path = sys.argv[2]
    load_and_export(model_path, output_path)

```

The main block of the script is executed only when the script is run directly (not imported as a module). It checks if the script is called with the correct command-line arguments (the Llama model folder path and the output path). If the required arguments are not provided, it prints a message indicating the correct usage and exits.

If the correct arguments are provided, it retrieves the `model_path` and `output_path` from the command-line arguments and then calls the `load_and_export` function with these paths to begin the export process.
